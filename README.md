# [DigiPixel](http://www.bradsprojects.com/the-digipixel/) - The DigiPixel

The DigiPixel is an open source Arduino and Digispark compatible shield with a
64 pixel RGB LED display and six buttons. The DigiPixel comes with it’s own
Arduino library, graphic converter and demo sketches (as seen in the video) to
help you get started with making your own DigiPixel creations.

## So what sort of things could I make with the DigiPixel?

Well, it’s really up to your imagination! You could make a game of Space
Invaders, Tetris or perhaps Snake. You could write messages in the air and
capture it on your camera with the AirWrite function. You could keep track of
Facebook likes, use it as an electronic dice, a scrolling desk clock or even a
digital name badge. It’s amazing what you can do with just 64 pixels!

## For contributors

If you want to help and provide new samples, improvements or bugfixes, you can
via github.

In general, fork the project, create a branch for a specific change and send a
pull request for that branch. Don't mix unrelated changes. You can use the
commit message as the description for the pull request.

## Using the DigiPixel Library

The DigiPixel comes with a Arduino library that you can Import into your
envionment.

You can download this repo straight away using the 
[**Download ZIP**](https://github.com/bradsprojects/DigiPixel/archive/master.zip) 
link to get the latest files.  Note: due to the way github automatically
creates this zip file, you do need to extract it somewhere so you can point
the Import Library function to the internal **DigiPixel** folder for the
import to work properly.

You can find general instructions here, http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries,
generally speaking in yoru Arduino IDE, you need to goto **Sketch -> Import
Library ...** and select the "**DigiPixel**" subfolder inside the folder where
you extracted this repository.  Doing this will make the library and also the
included example programs available to you.  (You can find the Examples under
**File -> Examples -> DigiPixel** menu)
